An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be subclassed. It defines a common interface and optionally provides default implementations for methods. The primary purpose of the abc module is to support the concept of abstract base classes and provide a mechanism for defining abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The abc module is used for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Defining Abstract Base Classes (ABCs):\n",
    "The abc module allows you to define abstract base classes using the ABC class as a base. An abstract base class provides a common interface for its subclasses, defining the methods that must be implemented by those subclasses. By defining an abstract base class, you can ensure that specific methods are present in the subclasses, enforcing a contract that all subclasses must adhere to.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Enforcing Method Implementation:\n",
    "The abc module allows you to define abstract methods within abstract base classes. An abstract method is a method that has no implementation in the abstract base class and must be implemented by any concrete subclass. When a subclass fails to implement an abstract method, it raises a TypeError at runtime, notifying the programmer about the missing implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Supporting Polymorphism:\n",
    "Abstract base classes provide a way to achieve polymorphism in Python. By defining a common interface in an abstract base class, you can write code that works with objects of different classes as long as they adhere to the interface defined by the abstract base class. This promotes code reuse and enables writing more generic code that can handle various implementations."

    "n Python, we can achieve data abstraction through the use of classes and object-oriented programming (OOP) techniques. Data abstraction involves hiding the internal implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential information or behavior to the outside world. It allows us to work with objects at a higher level of understanding without being concerned about the internal complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some techniques to achieve data abstraction in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation:\n",
    "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in OOP and a key component of data abstraction. It involves bundling data (attributes) and methods (behaviors) together within an object. By encapsulating data, we can control access to it and provide public methods (interfaces) to manipulate or retrieve the data. This way, we can hide the internal implementation details and only expose the necessary information to the outside world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access Modifiers:\n",
    "Python does not have strict access modifiers like some other programming languages (e.g., private, public, protected), but we can use naming conventions to indicate the intended visibility of attributes and methods. By convention, attributes or methods that start with a single underscore (_) are considered as internal use, implying that they should not be accessed directly from outside the class. Attributes or methods that start with a double underscore (__) indicate name mangling, which makes them harder to access outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getters and Setters:\n",
    "To provide controlled access to attributes, we can use getter and setter methods. Getters are methods that retrieve the value of an attribute, while setters are methods that modify the value of an attribute. By using getter and setter methods, we can implement validation logic, perform data transformations, or enforce certain rules while accessing or modifying the data. This way, we maintain control over the data and ensure that it is used correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Property Decorators:\n",
    "In Python, we can also use property decorators to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute. The property decorator allows us to define a method as an attribute, and when that attribute is accessed or modified, the corresponding getter or setter method is invoked. Property decorators provide a concise and Pythonic way to implement data abstraction by encapsulating attribute access."
